# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my first task as a Web Development Intern, where I designed and developed a portfolio website from scratch. The website focuses on delivering an optimal user experience (UX) and a visually appealing user interface (UI). Additionally, I integrated a **Chat Assistant** feature to enhance user interaction and engagement.

## 🚀 About the Project

I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my first task as a Web Development Intern. My assignment was to create a portfolio website from scratch, focusing on both UX/UI design and development. In this project, I walk you through the design process, the decisions I made to enhance user experience, and finally, the fully developed site.

As part of this project, I also implemented a **Chat Assistant** feature. This interactive chatbot allows visitors to ask questions, get quick responses, and navigate the portfolio more efficiently. The Chat Assistant is designed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.
